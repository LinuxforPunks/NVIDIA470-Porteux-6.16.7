don't use these - get the originals from their repositories. These are not all of the needed files to make the 470 driver. 
There is also the .run from the nvidia website (which is 200+ MB so too large for GitHub) 
and also there are the patches needed for the 6.16.7 kernel.

Most important are the two SlackBuilds - these shouldn't require much or any editing

The other files need to be obtained and put in the expected directories (e.g. patches together in a 'patches' directory)
